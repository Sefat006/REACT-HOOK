# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


by using UseRef(), it makes easy to change anything without writing a long code;

in app.jsx : the basic way to use UseRef() is shown

in Attribute.jsx: the way to add and change an image on react and how to set height and width of the image through the react ;

UserRefInput: how to take input and show it in alert 

ClassCss: how to edit and add a cls of tailwind or boostrap

MutedValue: this will show the result without changing anything from the webpage; this one is actually use for any inner calculation
